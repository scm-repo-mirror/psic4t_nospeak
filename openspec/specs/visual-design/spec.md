# Visual Design Specification

## Purpose
This spec defines the shared visual design system for the nospeak web client, including glassmorphism treatment, color palette, typography, motion, and layout patterns used across authenticated and unauthenticated states.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Consistent glassmorphism visual language
The application interface SHALL use the glass & slate visual language described in this spec for primary containers, backgrounds, and interactive elements so that users experience a cohesive, modern UI across screens and themes.

#### Scenario: Apply glassmorphism to primary surfaces
- **WHEN** rendering primary app surfaces such as chat windows, navigation bars, and modals
- **THEN** those surfaces SHALL use semi-transparent backgrounds with blur, soft rounded corners, and subtle borders/shadows consistent with the values defined in this spec
- **AND** the implementation SHOULD respect both light and dark theme tokens while preserving legibility.

### Requirement: URL Preview Card Visual Design
The URL preview card for non-media links in chat messages SHALL follow the existing messaging visual design system, using Catppuccin theme tokens for colors, typography, and spacing. The card SHALL present link metadata in a compact, readable layout that works across desktop and mobile breakpoints.

#### Scenario: Preview card layout and theming
- **WHEN** a URL preview card is rendered under a message bubble
- **THEN** the card SHALL use a background and border treatment that clearly associates it with the message while remaining visually distinct from the message text
- **AND** the card SHALL display the link title as primary text, the effective domain as secondary text, and MAY show a short description when available
- **AND** all text and icon colors SHALL respect the active Catppuccin theme (Latte or Frappe) for readability and contrast.

#### Scenario: Responsive behavior on mobile and desktop
- **GIVEN** the user views a conversation on a mobile device or a desktop device
- **WHEN** a URL preview card is rendered
- **THEN** the card layout SHALL adapt so that content remains legible without horizontal scrolling
- **AND** any thumbnail or favicon image SHALL scale or reposition to avoid overwhelming the text content on small screens.

#### Scenario: Hover, focus, and active states
- **WHEN** the user hovers over, focuses, or activates the URL preview card
- **THEN** the card SHALL provide clear visual feedback (such as subtle background or border changes) consistent with other interactive elements in the messaging UI
- **AND** focus indicators SHALL be visible and accessible for keyboard and assistive technology users.

### Requirement: Mobile contacts header app name styling
The nospeak app name label in the mobile contacts sidebar header SHALL follow the existing visual design system for typography, spacing, and glassmorphism so that the label feels integrated with the rest of the interface.

#### Scenario: App name label matches visual language
- **GIVEN** the nospeak app name label is rendered next to the current user's avatar in the contacts header on a mobile-sized layout
- **WHEN** the header is displayed in light or dark theme
- **THEN** the label uses a small, bold type treatment consistent with other header labels
- **AND** the text color respects the active Catppuccin theme for readability
- **AND** the spacing between the avatar, label, and settings control aligns with the glassmorphism-based layout without causing overlap or truncation in typical mobile widths.

## 1. Design Philosophy

The application follows a "Glass & Slate" aesthetic, prioritizing depth, motion, and airiness over flat utility. The interface simulates a floating glass layer over a dynamic background, creating a sense of context and modernity.

## 2. Visual Language

### Glassmorphism
*   **Surface:** Primary containers and overlays use semi-transparent backgrounds with background blur.
    *   Light Mode: `bg-white/70` with `backdrop-blur-xl`.
    *   Dark Mode: `bg-slate-900/70` with `backdrop-blur-xl`.
*   **Borders:** Subtle, translucent borders define edges without harsh contrast.
    *   `border-white/20` (Light) or `border-white/10` (Dark).
*   **Shadows:** Deep, diffuse shadows (`shadow-2xl`) lift floating elements (modals, main window) off the background.
*   **Background:** Ambient, blurred gradient blobs (Blue/Purple) provide depth behind the glass layers.

### Color Palette
*   **Theme:** Catppuccin (Mocha/Latte).
*   **Dark Mode Base (Mocha):** Overrides `slate` palette.
    *   Background: `#11111b` (Crust)
    *   Surface: `#1e1e2e` (Base)
    *   Sidebar: `#181825` (Mantle)
    *   Text: `#cdd6f4` (Text)
*   **Light Mode Base (Latte):** Overrides `gray` palette.
    *   Background: `#eff1f5` (Base)
    *   Surface: `#ffffff` (Base/White)
*   **Accents:**
    *   Primary: **Lavender** (`#7287fd` -> `#5b6ee1`) overriding `blue` palette.
    *   Success: `Green-500`
    *   Error: `Red-500`

### Shapes & Geometry
*   **Windows & Modals:** Large `rounded-3xl` corners.
*   **List Items & Bubbles:** Soft `rounded-2xl` corners.
*   **Inputs & Buttons:** Full "Pill" shapes (`rounded-full` or `rounded-xl`).
*   **Avatars:** Circular (`rounded-full`) with a subtle ring (`ring-white/50` or `ring-white/10`) to separate from glass backgrounds.

### Typography
*   **Font:** System sans-serif, `antialiased` for crisp rendering.
*   **Weights:**
    *   Headers: `font-bold`
    *   Body: `font-normal` or `font-medium`
    *   Labels: `font-medium`

## 3. Layout Architecture

### Authenticated State
*   **App Window:** A single, central glass container holding the Sidebar (Contacts) and Main Content (Chat).
*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   Desktop: Floating centered window with rounded corners and padding.
    *   Mobile: Full-screen glass interface.
*   **Modals:** Rendered at the root level (`+layout.svelte`) to overlay the entire application window and background.

### Unauthenticated State
*   **Login Modal:** A focused, free-floating glass card centered on the background.
*   **App Window:** Hidden until successful authentication.

## 4. Motion & Interaction

### Transitions
*   **Page Navigation:** Subtle `fade` (150ms) transition when switching contexts (e.g., chat threads).
*   **Modals:** Fade-in backdrop with scaled content entry.
*   **Messages:** `fly` (y: 20px) entrance animation with `cubicOut` easing.

### Micro-interactions
*   **Hover:** Elements (contacts, buttons) brighten and/or shift background color.
*   **Active:** Interactive elements scale down (`scale-95`) on press for tactile feedback.
*   **Haptics:** Soft vibration on mobile interactions where supported.

## 5. Loading States
*   **Skeleton Loaders:** Pulsing shapes (gray/slate blocks) replace spinners for content loading (Profile, Contacts).
*   **Spinners:** Minimal use, primarily for action states (e.g., "Sending", "Saving").
