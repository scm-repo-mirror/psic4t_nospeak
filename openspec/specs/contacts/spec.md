## Requirements
### Requirement: Contact Storage via Kind 30000 Encrypted Follow Set
The system SHALL store the user's contacts as a Kind 30000 parameterized replaceable event with `d` tag value `dm-contacts`. Contact pubkeys SHALL be stored privately in the encrypted content field using NIP-44 self-encryption, not as public `p` tags. The event SHALL be published to both messaging relays and discovery relays when contacts change. When contacts are fetched from relays and merged into local storage, the system SHALL resolve profiles for newly added contacts using batch profile resolution.

#### Scenario: Contact list published on contact add
- **GIVEN** the user adds a new contact via the Manage Contacts modal
- **WHEN** the contact is successfully added to local storage
- **THEN** the system SHALL publish an updated Kind 30000 event with `d: "dm-contacts"`
- **AND** the content field SHALL contain NIP-44 encrypted JSON array of `[["p", "<pubkey>"], ...]` tags
- **AND** the event SHALL be published to the user's messaging relays and discovery relays

#### Scenario: Contact list published on contact remove
- **GIVEN** the user removes a contact via the Manage Contacts modal
- **WHEN** the contact is removed from local storage
- **THEN** the system SHALL publish an updated Kind 30000 event reflecting the removal
- **AND** the encrypted content SHALL no longer include the removed contact's pubkey

#### Scenario: Contact list fetched on profile refresh
- **GIVEN** the user is authenticated and a profile refresh is triggered
- **WHEN** the system fetches profile data from relays
- **THEN** it SHALL also fetch the user's Kind 30000 event with `d: "dm-contacts"`
- **AND** decrypt the content using NIP-44
- **AND** merge any remote contacts not in local storage using union merge (never delete)

#### Scenario: Profiles resolved for contacts from Kind 30000
- **GIVEN** the user is authenticated and has a Kind 30000 event with 5 contacts on relays
- **AND** 3 of those contacts are not in local storage
- **WHEN** the system fetches and merges contacts during sync
- **THEN** the 3 new contacts SHALL be added to local storage
- **AND** the system SHALL fetch Kind 0, 10050, 10002, and 10063 events for all 3 contacts in a single batch request
- **AND** the profiles SHALL be cached so usernames and pictures are immediately available

#### Scenario: Batch profile resolution uses multi-author filter
- **GIVEN** 10 new contacts need profile resolution after Kind 30000 merge
- **WHEN** the system resolves profiles for the new contacts
- **THEN** a single relay subscription SHALL be created with `authors: [pubkey1, pubkey2, ...]` containing all 10 pubkeys
- **AND** the filter SHALL request kinds 0, 10050, 10002, and 10063
- **AND** the resolution SHALL complete within 5 seconds timeout

#### Scenario: Partial profile resolution succeeds
- **GIVEN** 5 new contacts need profile resolution
- **AND** only 3 of them have Kind 0 events available on relays
- **WHEN** the batch profile resolution completes
- **THEN** the 3 available profiles SHALL be cached with usernames and pictures
- **AND** the 2 contacts without profiles SHALL remain in the contacts list
- **AND** those 2 contacts SHALL display with truncated npub until profiles become available

### Requirement: Contact Auto-Add and Sync on Unknown Message
When a message is received from an unknown sender, the system SHALL auto-add the sender as a contact and trigger a Kind 30000 sync to persist the new contact.

#### Scenario: Unknown sender auto-added and synced
- **GIVEN** a gift-wrap message is received from a pubkey not in the user's contacts
- **WHEN** the message is successfully decrypted and processed
- **THEN** the sender SHALL be auto-added as a contact with `lastReadAt = 0` (unread)
- **AND** the system SHALL publish an updated Kind 30000 event including the new contact

### Requirement: Manage Contacts Modal Navigation
The Manage Contacts modal SHALL allow users to navigate directly to a chat with a contact by clicking on that contact's row. Clicking a contact SHALL close the modal and navigate to the chat view for that contact. The modal SHALL NOT display a direct delete button on each contact row; instead, contact deletion SHALL be accessible via the contact context menu.

#### Scenario: Contact click opens chat
- **GIVEN** the user has opened the Manage Contacts modal
- **AND** the modal displays a list of existing contacts
- **WHEN** the user clicks on a contact row (not on the 3-dot menu button)
- **THEN** the modal SHALL close

- **WHEN** the contact list is rendered
- **THEN** there SHALL NOT be a visible delete button (trash icon) directly on each contact row
- **AND** the delete action SHALL only be accessible via the context menu

### Requirement: New Contact Button in Manage Contacts Modal

- **WHEN** the user clicks the "New Contact" button
- **THEN** the search input field SHALL receive focus
- **AND** the user can enter an npub, NIP-05 identifier, or search term to add a new contact

### Requirement: Chat List Sidebar with FAB Button
The main sidebar SHALL be named "Chats" (internally `chatList`) and SHALL display a floating action button (FAB) in the lower-right corner that opens the Manage Contacts modal when tapped.

#### Scenario: FAB button opens contacts modal

- **WHEN** the Chats sidebar is rendered
- **THEN** it SHALL display contacts ordered by most recent message activity
- **AND** the header title SHALL display "Chats" instead of "Contacts"
- **AND** there SHALL be no "Manage" button in the header area

### Requirement: Profile Resolution Uses Discovery Relays
When resolving a contact's profile (kind 0, 10050, 10002, 10063 events), the system SHALL query both the user's connected messaging relays AND discovery relays. Discovery relay connections SHALL be temporary and cleaned up when the profile resolution completes.

#### Scenario: NIP-05 contact search finds profile on discovery relay
- **GIVEN** the user is searching for a contact via NIP-05 address (e.g., `alice@example.com`)
- **AND** the NIP-05 lookup successfully returns the contact's pubkey
- **AND** the contact's kind 0 profile event exists on a discovery relay but not on the user's messaging relays
- **WHEN** the system calls `ProfileResolver.resolveProfile()` for the contact
- **THEN** the system SHALL query both the user's messaging relays AND discovery relays
- **AND** the profile SHALL be successfully fetched from the discovery relay
- **AND** the contact's name and picture SHALL be displayed in the search results

#### Scenario: Discovery relay connections cleaned up after profile resolution
- **GIVEN** the system has connected to discovery relays as part of profile resolution
- **WHEN** the profile resolution subscription is closed (either by timeout or successful completion)
- **THEN** the temporary discovery relay connections that were added for this subscription SHALL be removed
- **AND** the user's persistent messaging relay connections SHALL remain active

### Requirement: Proactive Discovery Relay Connection on Search Input
When the user begins typing in the contact search field, the system SHALL proactively connect to discovery relays before the search query is executed. This ensures discovery relays are ready when the NIP-05 profile fetch is triggered.

#### Scenario: Discovery relays connected on first keystroke
- **GIVEN** the user opens the Manage Contacts modal or contacts page
- **AND** no search query has been entered yet
- **WHEN** the user types the first character in the search input field

- **WHEN** the user continues typing additional characters
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT attempt to connect to discovery relays again
- **AND** the existing connection attempts SHALL continue uninterrupted

### Requirement: Android Contacts Route
On the Android native app, contacts management SHALL be accessible via a dedicated `/contacts` route instead of a modal overlay. When the user navigates to `/contacts` on Android, the system SHALL display a full-screen contacts view with the same functionality as the Manage Contacts modal.
