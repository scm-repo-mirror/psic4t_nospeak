## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Startup Navigation
The system SHALL handle application startup navigation differently based on the device form factor to optimize user experience.

#### Scenario: Desktop Startup
- **GIVEN** the user is on a desktop device (screen width > 768px)
- **WHEN** the user navigates to the root chat URL (`/chat`)
- **THEN** the system automatically redirects to the most recently active conversation

#### Scenario: Mobile Startup
- **GIVEN** the user is on a mobile device (screen width <= 768px)
- **WHEN** the user navigates to the root chat URL (`/chat`)
- **THEN** the system displays the contact list
- **AND** does not redirect to a conversation

#### Scenario: URL Persistence on Reload
- **GIVEN** the user is viewing a specific conversation (e.g., `/chat/<npub>`)
- **WHEN** the user reloads the page
- **THEN** the system restores the same conversation view
- **AND** does not redirect to a different conversation or the contact list
