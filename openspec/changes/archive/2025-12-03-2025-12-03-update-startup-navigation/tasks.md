## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update `src/routes/chat/+layout.svelte` to detect mobile/desktop context (e.g. window width).
- [x] 1.2 Modify redirection logic to only auto-redirect to the latest contact if on desktop AND at the root `/chat` path.
- [x] 1.3 Ensure mobile users remain on `/chat` (contact list) on startup.
- [x] 1.4 Verify reloading a specific conversation URL does not redirect away on either platform.
