## Context

Nospeak uses NIP-17 direct messages with encrypted relay storage. Contacts are already stored as an encrypted Kind 30000 parameterized replaceable event (`dm-contacts`) with NIP-44 self-encryption. This design replicates that pattern for message favorites using a `dm-favorites` d-tag.

The ChatList currently shows conversations with filter tabs (All/Unread/Groups). The message context menu supports Cite and Copy actions. Messages are rendered in ChatView with bubble styling and metadata rows.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Allow users to favorite/unfavorite individual messages via context menu
- Persist favorites across devices using encrypted relay storage
- Provide a dedicated Favorites view accessible from the ChatList
- Show visual indicator (star overlay) on favorited messages in conversations
- Navigate from a favorite directly to its original conversation and position

**Non-Goals:**
- Syncing favorites in real-time across simultaneously active devices (login-time sync is sufficient)
- Favorite annotations or categories
- Sharing favorites with other users
- Full-text search within favorites

## Decisions

### 1. Encrypted List Storage via Kind 30000

Store favorites as a Kind 30000 event with `d: "dm-favorites"`, same event kind and encryption approach as contacts. The encrypted content uses `[["e", "<eventId>", "<conversationId>"], ...]` tag format to store both the message reference and its conversation context.

**Rationale:** Reusing the proven `dm-contacts` pattern minimizes new code and ensures consistency. Storing `conversationId` alongside `eventId` enables the Favorites view to group messages by conversation and navigate back without a database join.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Adding a boolean `isFavorite` field to the Message table: Rejected because it wouldn't sync across devices and requires schema migration for every message row.
- Using a separate Nostr event kind: Rejected because Kind 30000 is the established NIP-51 list kind, and using a different d-tag is the standard way to create distinct private lists.

### 2. Local IndexedDB Table + Reactive Store

Create a `favorites` table in IndexedDB (schema v11) with `eventId` as primary key and `conversationId` + `createdAt` indices. A Svelte writable store holds the set of favorited eventIds for O(1) lookup in the UI render loop.

**Rationale:** The store avoids async DB queries during message rendering. The IndexedDB table provides persistence and allows the Favorites view to query all favorites with conversation grouping.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Store-only without IndexedDB: Rejected because favorites would be lost on page reload until relay sync completes.
- Dexie liveQuery only: Rejected because liveQuery adds subscription overhead per message; a pre-loaded Set is more efficient for the hot render path.

### 3. Sync at Same Points as Contacts

Favorites are fetched/published at the exact same integration points as contacts: on login (`AuthService`), delayed refresh (`+layout.svelte`), and own profile refresh (`ProfileModal.svelte`). Publishing is fire-and-forget on toggle.

**Rationale:** This ensures consistent behavior and avoids introducing new sync timing logic. Users already understand the contact sync cadence.

### 4. Dedicated `/favorites` Route

Create a new SvelteKit route at `/favorites` that displays all favorited messages grouped by conversation. Clicking a message navigates to `/chat/<conversationId>?highlight=<eventId>` to scroll to and highlight the original message.

**Rationale:** A dedicated route is simpler than a modal overlay and allows deep linking. The `highlight` query parameter is a lightweight way to communicate the target message to ChatView without adding route complexity.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Modal overlay: Rejected because it limits screen space for browsing potentially many favorites.
- Inline expansion in ChatList: Rejected because it would complicate the ChatList component and conflict with the filter tabs.

### 5. Star Icon as Absolute Overlay

Display a small star icon badge in the top-right corner of favorited message bubbles using CSS absolute positioning. The badge uses the app's lavender accent color (`--color-lavender-rgb`) for the circular background with a white star SVG. The badge is positioned outside the message bubble's `overflow-hidden` container using a relative wrapper to prevent clipping.

**Rationale:** Top-right overlay is visually distinct without affecting message layout or content flow. Using the app's lavender color maintains visual consistency with the overall design theme. Positioning outside the overflow container ensures the badge renders fully without being clipped.

### 6. ChatList Favorites Entry Styling

The ChatList favorites entry uses a minimalist design with horizontal divider lines extending from both sides of the centered content. The entry displays a small lavender star icon (without circular background), the "Favorites" label, and the count inline. The entry is only visible when the "All" filter is active, maintaining a clean interface when viewing filtered subsets (Unread/Groups).

**Rationale:** The horizontal lines create visual separation without adding UI chrome. The inline count and lack of subtitle text make the entry compact. Limiting visibility to the "All" filter avoids clutter when users are focusing on specific subsets of conversations.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Full avatar with circle background: Rejected as too heavy for a secondary navigation element.
- Always visible regardless of filter: Rejected to reduce cognitive load when viewing filtered lists.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Union-only merge may accumulate stale favorites**: If a message is deleted or conversation is lost, the favorite reference persists. Mitigation: The Favorites view gracefully handles missing messages by showing a "message unavailable" placeholder.
- **No real-time cross-device sync**: A favorite added on device A won't appear on device B until next login/refresh. Mitigation: Acceptable for initial implementation; matches contact sync behavior.
- **Relay publish failure**: If all relay publishes fail, favorites exist locally but not remotely. Mitigation: Next successful publish will include all local favorites (full state publish, not delta).
- **Large favorite lists**: Very large lists could slow down the encrypt/publish cycle. Mitigation: Unlikely in practice for individual favorites; if needed, pagination can be added later.

## Migration Plan

- Database schema v11 adds the `favorites` table. Dexie handles this automatically on next app load.
- No data migration needed — new table starts empty.
- No breaking changes to existing functionality.
- Rollback: Remove the favorites table in a subsequent schema version if needed.
