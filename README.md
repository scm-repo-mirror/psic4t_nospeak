- 🎨 **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark/light theme support
- 📝 **Rich Text**: Support for markdown formatting and emojis
- 🔗 **Universal URLs**: Media files accessible across Nostr clients

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nospeak.git
cd nospeak

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run type checking and linting
npm run check

# Run tests
npm run vitest
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **ConnectionManager**: Handles Nostr relay connections and subscriptions
- **MessagingService**: Manages message sending/receiving with encryption
- **AuthService**: Handles user authentication with Nostr keys
- **ProfileService**: Manages user profiles and metadata
- **MessageRepository**: Local database storage for messages

### Key Technologies

- **SvelteKit**: Modern web framework with SSR support
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Dexie**: IndexedDB wrapper for local storage
- **Nostr Tools**: Nostr protocol implementation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

## Media Upload

Nospeak supports uploading images and videos to enhance chat conversations:

### Supported Formats

**Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP (max 10MB)
**Videos**: MP4, WebM, MOV (max 50MB)

### How It Works

1. Click the upload button (📎) next to message input
2. Select "Image" or "Video" from dropdown
3. Choose file from your device
4. File uploads with progress indicator
5. Full URL inserted into message (works in any Nostr client)
6. Media displays inline in chat bubbles

### File Storage

- Files stored with UUID names in `static/user_media/`
- Served via full URLs for cross-client compatibility
- Automatic cleanup and optimization in production

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` file for local development:

```env
# Optional: Custom relay configuration
NOSTR_RELAYS=wss://relay1.nostr.org,wss://relay2.nostr.org
```

### Relay Configuration

Default relays are configured, but users can add custom relays in settings. The app automatically:

- Connects to multiple relays for redundancy
- Handles connection failures with retry logic
- Manages subscription optimization

## Security

### Encryption

- All messages are end-to-end encrypted using Nostr's NIP-04
- Private keys never leave the user's device
- Profile metadata is publicly shared as per Nostr protocol

### Data Storage

- Local IndexedDB for message history and profiles
- No server-side storage of private data
- Automatic cleanup of old cache data

## Android (Capacitor)

Nospeak can be packaged as a native Android application using Capacitor.

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Android Studio with Android SDK and platform tools
- Java 17 (for recent Android Gradle plugin versions)
- At least one Android emulator or physical device (Android 8.0 / API 26 or newer)

### Setup and Build

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build web assets and sync to Android project
npm run build:android

# Open the Android project in Android Studio
npm run android
```

The Capacitor configuration (`capacitor.config.ts`) is set to use the SvelteKit `build/android` directory as `webDir`, so the Android app loads the bundled nospeak UI from local assets.

### Signing and Release (summary)

- Configure a release keystore in the Android module (`android/app`) using Android Studio.
- Set up a release build variant and signing config for the app ID `com.nospeak.app`.
- Generate a signed App Bundle (AAB) or APK via **Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK** in Android Studio.
- Upload the signed artifact to the Google Play Console or your chosen distribution channel following their standard submission flow.

## Deployment

### Docker

```dockerfile
# Build image
docker build -t nospeak .

# Run container
docker run -p 5173:5173 nospeak
```

### Static Hosting

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy build/ directory to your static host
rsync -av build/ user@server:/var/www/nospeak/
```

### Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use 4-space indentation
- Write tests for new features
- Keep components small and focused
- Follow existing code patterns

## Nostr Integration

Nospeak Web implements the following NIPs (Nostr Implementation Proposals):

### Core Protocol
- **NIP-01**: Basic protocol flow and event structure
- **NIP-05**: Mapping Nostr keys to DNS-based internet identifiers (nip05)
- **NIP-19**: bech32-encoded entities for keys and identifiers

### Metadata & Profiles
- **NIP-28**: Relay list metadata for server discovery
- **NIP-40**: Reaction events for emoji responses

### Content & Media
- **NIP-44**: Outbox model for draft message management
- **NIP-59**: Gift wrapper events for media sharing
- **NIP-65**: Relay list filtering and management

### Advanced Features
- **NIP-07**: Windowed messages for rate limiting
- **NIP-09**: Event delegation for key management
- **NIP-26**: Parameterized replaceable events
